# DiplomaChessEngine

This is a chess engine for a Bachelor degree diploma. It is my second chess engine. I've decided to build it from scrach using bitboards, as it's a much better aproach than object oriented calculations.

In this version I've strongly improved evaluation functions and minimax algorithm speed.
